## Melanney Orta

This project is an exploratory analysis of LEGO sets in Mexico with several visualizations created
in plotly and written in R using R Markdown as part of CS544's Final Project. This uses the LEGO Sets
Mexico dataset on Kaggle by Carlos Alvarez at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosalvro/lego-sets-dataset?resource=download.
